# Latte Lab website rebuild

## Approved direction

Rebuild lattelab-web as a Next.js 16 social club website. Warm cream, forest green, espresso type, real Drive artwork, restrained animation. Home stays short; scrapbook is a scrolling paper collage with no physical book. Preserve Git history; no backup copy.

## Pages

- /: concise hero, animated club artwork, join and scrapbook links, small photo strip.
- /about: who we are, what we do, and ethos as a connected story.
- /team: current leadership with verified names and roles.
- /scrapbook: All / Events / Drinks filters, Polaroids, accessible photo viewer and load more.
- /news: existing press, distinguishing Latte Lab coverage from broader MIT coffee stories.
- /join: membership form, separate club application, Instagram, email.
- Email links use mailto:lattelab-exec@mit.edu; no login or contact form.

## Tasks and acceptance

- [x] Inspect clean source tree; create codex/club-website-rebuild.
- [x] Preserve five press records and remove old application source.
- [x] Collect real brand assets and photo selections. User requested placeholder form links; both destinations remain intentionally unset.
- [x] Build Next.js 16 foundation, design tokens, navigation and footer.
- [x] Implement concise animated homepage.
- [x] Implement About, Team and Join.
- [x] Implement scrapbook filtering, viewer and pagination.
- [x] Implement News, metadata, sitemap, redirects and not-found page.
- [x] Verify build, lint, types, interactions, accessibility and responsive screenshots.
- [x] Document maintenance and report any outstanding content gaps.

## Technical decisions

Use App Router / React 19 / TypeScript / Tailwind 4, npm lockfile, optimized local images and fonts. Content lives in typed files. No database required. CSS animation and small client components; honor reduced motion and retain readable content without animation. No production deployment until preview review.

## Progress log

- 2026-09-16: Started from ef72b28, clean working tree. Branch created. Old UI removed after preserving press content. Existing Next.js configuration disabled image optimization and suppressed type errors; new configuration will remove those bypasses.

- Downloaded 9 original brand assets and optimized 15 photos locally. The gallery uses 12 curated entries from Blueprint, SAAS collaboration, and social/recipe-testing collections.
- All six pages implemented. Four gallery filtering tests passed after reproducing missing filtering behavior. Initial production build passed. Browser preview now works in the in-app browser.
- Form destinations intentionally remain placeholders at user request. Team uses verified handbook names/roles and illustrative brand cards; no unverified portrait identities.
- Dependency audit found the previous lockfile retained old Next.js packages; updating to patched Next.js 16 before final verification.

## Final verification — 2026-09-16

- Next.js 16.3.5 production build, ESLint, TypeScript, and all four gallery tests passed. npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities. git diff --check passed.
- Browser-reviewed Home, About, Team, Join, News, and Scrapbook. Mobile widths of 390px and 320px checked; sampled pages have no horizontal overflow. Mobile menu opens and closes after navigation.
- Verified Drinks filtering, load-more rendering all 12 entries, photo modal, Escape dismissal, and focus restoration. Motion has a reduced-motion stylesheet override. This is a focused manual check, not a full accessibility audit.
- HTTP smoke checks passed for all six pages, robots, sitemap, Open Graph image, contact redirect (308), and unknown page (404).
- Added README, canonical CLAUDE.md, formatted source, and Drive asset provenance.

## Deliberate content follow-ups

- Replace the two null form destinations in content/site.ts with public respondent URLs when ready. User explicitly requested placeholders for now.
- Replace illustrated team cards with verified portraits if desired.
- Review copy and photo selection in the local preview before production deployment. Changes remain local on codex/club-website-rebuild; no DNS, Vercel, remote Git, or production changes made.

## Release authorization

- 2026-09-16: User approved merging and production deployment. Tests, lint, types, production build and diff checks passed again before release.

## Join links — 2026-09-17

- Replaced both placeholder destinations with verified public Google Forms links. Resolved the membership editing URL to its canonical respondent URL.
- Clarified hyperlink labels and descriptions to distinguish the membership mailing list from the internal club team application. Both open in a new tab with accessible notice.

## About illustrations — 2026-09-17

- Enlarged the three activity illustrations to 180px on desktop, 130px on tablet, and a 90px-wide mobile column. Updated image sizing hints to retain sharp rendering.

## About group photo — 2026-09-17

- Replaced the About hero photo with user-supplied IMG_7876.jpeg, optimized to WebP. Used a landscape CSS frame and gentle zoom to trim empty floor without altering the original photo or cutting out members.

## Signature footer — 2026-09-17

- Approved forest/cream footer with original sweater wordmark, Join CTA, Instagram and email.
- Lightweight CSS SVG mask, once-per-mount viewport reveal, mouse-following caramel highlight, static reduced-motion fallback, responsive sizing. Original artwork preserved at public/brand/wordmark.svg.
- Verification: lint and production build passed; desktop reveal and complete wordmark visually checked, mobile layout reviewed at 390px.

## Automatic footer glow — 2026-09-17

- Replaced cursor-driven highlight with a continuous, slow caramel gradient sweep. Runs on mobile too; reduced motion retains the static cream wordmark. Removed pointer event handling.

## Footer load and analytics — 2026-09-17

- Live SVG measured 5,752 bytes and ~0.23s for one request; not a broad performance benchmark. Removed deliberate 1.1s reveal and client observer/hydration dependency.
- Original SVG paths are now inline in server-rendered HTML, eliminating the CSS-mask image fetch while retaining the automatic glow and reduced-motion fallback.
- Installed official Vercel Analytics and added its Next.js component once in the root layout.

## Speed Insights — 2026-09-18

- Added the official Next.js Speed Insights component once in the root layout alongside Web Analytics. No paid plan or subscription changes.

## Cream social preview — 2026-09-18

- Published the exact approved 1200×630 cream preview: original cup logo, Fraunces wordmark, and the selected MIT community description.
- Replaced the old generated image with a static PNG and descriptive alt metadata; removed the obsolete explicit image URL so Next.js supplies the file URL.

## Homepage title — 2026-09-18

- Simplified the default page title to Latte Lab, which supplies the homepage browser tab, Open Graph title, and Twitter title. Interior page titles retain their existing template.

## Footer LinkedIn — 2026-09-18

- Added the official LinkedIn company link beside Instagram and Email in the footer, opening in a new tab with an accessible notice.

## Local landing page exploration

- Branch: codex/landing-page-preview. Review locally only; do not push or deploy.
- Young Serif homepage headlines, centered beaver poster, short introduction linking to the existing /about page, three real photo Polaroids.
- Desktop memories use a short GSAP pin; mobile, short windows, and reduced motion show a normal static layout.
- Existing signature footer preserved; invitation links directly to the membership mailing list.

- Refined desktop memories into a centered photo stack that fans out over a short scroll pin; no pin on mobile or reduced motion.
- Added user-supplied IMG_5870.JPG to Events as Halloween 2025, optimized to WebP without altering the original. Source: /Users/datct/Downloads/IMG_5870.JPG.

- Added Halloween content filming photo from /Users/datct/Downloads/IMG_5847.JPG beside the Halloween group photo; optimized WebP with original orientation preserved.

- Added Latte Lab photoshoot shots from /Users/datct/Downloads/IMG_5431.jpeg to the scrapbook Events collection. Date omitted because none was supplied. Original preserved; optimized WebP used for the site.

- Added user-supplied IMG_9361.heic as passionfruit lemonade cold brew from the first event of fall 2026. Converted with macOS HEIC support and optimized to WebP; original unchanged. Replaced the landing page drink Polaroid with this photo.

- Replaced the landing “better together” photo with user-supplied DC0A2311.jpg. Rotated upright and fitted the full group into the Polaroid; source original unchanged. Local preview only.

- Swapped the landing “better together” image to 43900384_Unknown.JPG at the user’s request. Restored the standard full-bleed Polaroid crop for this landscape photo.

- Updated the landing “around campus” Polaroid with user-supplied 43636592_Unknown.JPG, optimized as around-campus-blueprint.webp. Local preview only.

- Replaced Join page CoffeeArt with the supplied wax_seal_sticker.png, optimized with transparency intact as member-wax-seal.webp. Local preview only.

- Added LinkedIn to Join page social links. Replaced header Join pill with a compact, softly rounded rectangle and smaller arrow; retained form-button styling. Local preview only.

- Simplified the second and third homepage headings to “About us” and “Brewing memories” to avoid repeating the coffee/company phrasing.

## Approved release

User approved merging all preview work to main without squashing and deploying. Removed the first-frame eyebrow. Final checks run before release; preserve the feature commit through a merge commit.

- Join copy refinement: removed eyebrow and “Pull up a chair”; “Find your way into Latte Lab.” is now the sole, modestly sized heading. Local review on codex/join-copy.

- Removed footer invitation text. A keyboard-accessible full-footer membership link now covers the main footer area; social/email links remain independently clickable above it.

- Added user-supplied 43901824_Unknown.JPG to scrapbook Events as “Matching sweaters, good company,” optimized to WebP. No date assumed.

- Added a user-supplied pasted photo to scrapbook Events as “A pourover lesson with Korean Momma” (id `korean-momma-pourover`), optimized to WebP. No date assumed; whiteboard in the photo reads “Korean Momma x Latte Lab pourover event.”

- Added a user-supplied pasted photo to scrapbook Events as “Brewing at the CSAIL R&D event” (id `csail-rd-event`), optimized to WebP. No date assumed; user identified it as a Latte Lab x CSAIL R&D event.

- Removed two scrapbook entries at user request: `blueprint-1` (“A cup to keep you going,” Hack Blueprint) and `saas-5` (“One more look at that pour,” SAAS collaboration). Deleted their WebP files; kept their Drive provenance in content/asset-sources.json.
